## Gmail clone

In this project, I have created a clone of Gmail, a widely used email service provided by Google. I implemented the login functionality, and then designed the complete interface to closely resemble the original Gmail experience.

> All the images are svg's, gathered by inspecting the gmail website and other's from the [hero icons](https://heroicons.com/) website.
